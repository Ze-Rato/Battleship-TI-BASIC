## General Info
The game size (*NAVAL1* + *NAVAL2*) is approximately **1Â 694 bytes** and It's writen in TI-BASIC. (**NOTE: This is the size on your calculator the file on other devices may varie**)

## Setting up the game
You can use TI Connect to send these program files to your graphic calculator. You should find *NAVAL1* and *NAVAL2* on programs. This was made on a ti-84 plus CE-T so it may not work in some calculators

## Playing the game
**PLACING THE BOATS:** *NAVAL1* is when the players select the spots they want their boats in. You control a "0" with the arrows and to place it you use ALPHA and the boat is ready, due to some more clean view I didn't use the while clear home methoed to uptdate the frames so if you move the "0" to a place that already had it the other "0" will visually disapear but regardless of that it's position is already saved!

**ATTACKING:** When both players are done placing the boats you start the attacking phase, the *PLAYER1* will be the first to attack. On this phase you will see a table of colums and lines similar to the one you saw at the placing boats phase the only difference is that this table represents the shots you've already fired, for example if you hit a boat on 1A it will be displayed as "X" if you missed a shot on A2 it will be displayed "0". To shot you just need to press enter when you're done with looking into previous shots, after that a input will appear asking for colums(1-8) you fill it and press enter then other one asking for lin(A-G) will appear and after you fill and once again press enter you will be able to shot, to know if your shot was either *HITTED* or *WATER* you can look at the superior right corner.

## Final Notes
If you have any suggestion on otimization, issues and improving the game in general it would be much apreciated since I'm still a begginner.

If you want to reset a game you can run *NAVAL1* but if want to 
continue a game (only works on the attacking and it will initiate on PLAYER1's turn) you will execute *NAVAL2*.
